library(RColorBrewer)
```


```{r}
library(RCy3)

```


```{r}
layoutNetwork(cwd, 'force-directed')

# choose any of the other possible layouts e.g.:
possible.layout.names <- getLayoutNames(cwd)
layoutNetwork (cwd, possible.layout.names[1])

# Test the connection to Cytoscape.

Cytoscape provides a number of canned visual styles. The code below explores some of these styles. For example check out the marquee style!

```{r}
setVisualStyle(cwd, "Marquee")
```

```{r}
saveImage(cwd,
          file.name="demo_marquee",
          image.type="png",
          h=350)

knitr::include_graphics("./demo_marquee.png")
```

```{r}
styles <- getVisualStyleNames(cwd)
styles
```

```{r}
#setVisualStyle(cwd, styles[13])
```

```{r}

prok_vir_cor <- read.delim("./virus_prok_cor_abundant.tsv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

## Have a peak at the first 6 rows
head(prok_vir_cor)
```


```{r}
g <- graph.data.frame(prok_vir_cor, directed = FALSE)

class(g)
```

```{r}
plot(g, vertex.size = 3, vertex.label = NA)
```

```{r}

Community structure detection algorithms try to find dense subgraphs within larger network graphs (i.e. clusters of well connected nodes that are densely connected themselves but sparsely connected to other nodes outside the cluster) . Here we use the classic Girvan & Newman betweenness clustering method. The igraph package has lots of different community detection algorithms (i.e. different methods for finding communities).
```{r}
cb <- cluster_edge_betweenness(g)
cb
```

```{r}
plot(cb, y=g, vertex.label=NA,  vertex.size=3)
```

```{r}
head( membership(cb) )
```

Node Degree

```{r}
# Calculate and plot node degree of our network
d <- degree(g)
hist(d, breaks=30, col="lightblue", main ="Node Degree Distribution")
```

```{r}
plot( degree_distribution(g), type="h" )
```

Google PageRank Score
```{r}
pr <- page_rank(g)
head(pr$vector)
```

Lets plot our network with nodes size scaled via this page rank centrality scores.
```{r}
# Make a size vector btwn 2 and 20 for node plotting size
v.size <- BBmisc::normalize(pr$vector, range=c(2,20), method="range")
plot(g, vertex.size=v.size, vertex.label=NA)
```

One of the simplest centrality scores is of course degree that we calculated previously and stored as the object d. Lets plot this one out also
```{r}
v.size <- BBmisc::normalize(d, range=c(2,20), method="range")
plot(g, vertex.size=v.size, vertex.label=NA)
```

Another very common centrality score is betweenness. The vertex and edge betweenness are (roughly) defined by the number of geodesics (shortest paths) going through a vertex or an edge.
```{r}
b <- betweenness(g)
v.size <- BBmisc::normalize(b, range=c(2,20), method="range")
plot(g, vertex.size=v.size, vertex.label=NA)
```

## Read taxonomic classification for network annotation
```{r}
phage_id_affiliation <- read.delim("./phage_ids_with_affiliation.tsv")
head(phage_id_affiliation)
```

```{r}
bac_id_affi <- read.delim("./prok_tax_from_silva.tsv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(bac_id_affi)
```

## Add taxonomic annotation data to network
In preparation for sending the networks to Cytoscape we will add in the taxonomic data.
```{r}
## Extract out our vertex names
genenet.nodes <- as.data.frame(vertex.attributes(g), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
head(genenet.nodes)
```

How may phage (i.e. ph_) entries do we have?
```{r}
length( grep("^ph_",genenet.nodes[,1]) )
```

Therefore we have 81 non phage nodes.

Now lets merge() these with the annotation data
```{r}
# We dont need all annotation data so lets make a reduced table 'z' for merging
z <- bac_id_affi[,c("Accession_ID", "Kingdom", "Phylum", "Class")]
n <- merge(genenet.nodes, z, by.x="name", by.y="Accession_ID", all.x=TRUE)
head(n)
```

```{r}
# Check on the column names before deciding what to merge
colnames(n)
```

```{r}
colnames(phage_id_affiliation)
```

```{r}
# Again we only need a subset of `phage_id_affiliation` for our purposes
y <- phage_id_affiliation[, c("first_sheet.Phage_id_network", "phage_affiliation","Tax_order", "Tax_subfamily")]

# Add the little phage annotation that we have
x <- merge(x=n, y=y, by.x="name", by.y="first_sheet.Phage_id_network", all.x=TRUE)

## Remove duplicates from multiple matches
x <- x[!duplicated( (x$name) ),]
head(x)
```

```{r}
genenet.nodes <- x
```

Add to the network the data related to the connections between the organisms, the edge data, and then prepare to send the nodes and edges to Cytoscape using the function cyPlot().
```{r}
genenet.edges <- data.frame(igraph::as_edgelist(g))
names(genenet.edges) <- c("name.1",
                          "name.2")
genenet.edges$Weight <- igraph::edge_attr(g)[[1]]

genenet.edges$name.1 <- as.character(genenet.edges$name.1)
genenet.edges$name.2 <- as.character(genenet.edges$name.2)
genenet.nodes$name <- as.character(genenet.nodes$name)

ug <- cyPlot(genenet.nodes,genenet.edges)
```

## Send network to Cytoscape using RCy3
Now we will send the network from R to Cytoscape.

To begin we create a connection in R that we can use to manipulate the networks and then we will delete any windows that were already in Cytoscape so that we don’t use up all of our memory.

```{r}
# Open a new connection and delete any existing windows/networks in Cy
cy <- CytoscapeConnection()
deleteAllWindows(cy)
```

```{r}
cw <- CytoscapeWindow("Tara oceans",
                      graph = ug,
                      overwriteWindow = TRUE)
```

```{r}
displayGraph(cw)
layoutNetwork(cw)
fitContent(cw)
```

## Colour network by prokaryotic phylum
```{r}
families_to_colour <- unique(genenet.nodes$Phylum)
families_to_colour <- families_to_colour[!is.na(families_to_colour)]

node.colour <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(length(families_to_colour), "Set3")

```

```{r}
setNodeColorRule(cw,
                 "Phylum",
                 families_to_colour,
                 node.colour,
                 "lookup",
                 default.color = "#ffffff")
```

```{r}
saveImage(cw,
          file.name="net2",
          image.type="png",
          h=350)
```

```{r}
library(knitr)
```

```{r}
include_graphics("./net2.png")
```

## Set node shape to reflect virus or prokaryote
Next we would like to change the shape of the node to reflect whether the nodes are viral or prokaryotic in origin. In this dataset all of the viral node names start with “ph_”, thus we can set the viral nodes to be diamond-shaped by looking for all the nodes that start with “ph” in the network.

```{r}
shapes_for_nodes <- c("DIAMOND")

phage_names <- grep("ph_",
                    genenet.nodes$name,
                    value = TRUE)
setNodeShapeRule(cw,
                 "label",
                 phage_names,
                 shapes_for_nodes)
```

```{r}
displayGraph(cw)
fitContent(cw)
```

## Colour edges of phage nodes
```{r}
setDefaultNodeBorderWidth(cw, 5)
families_to_colour <- c("Podoviridae",
                        "Siphoviridae",
                        "Myoviridae")

node.colour <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(length(families_to_colour),
                          "Dark2")
setNodeBorderColorRule(cw,
                       "Tax_subfamily",
                       families_to_colour,
                       node.colour,
                       "lookup", 
                       default.color = "#000000")
```

```{r}
displayGraph(cw)
fitContent(cw)
```

```{r}
saveImage(cw,
          "co-occur2",
          "png",
          h=350)
knitr::include_graphics("co-occur2.png")
```

##Use a network layout to minimize the overlap of nodes.
After doing all of this coloring to the network we would like to layout the network in a way that allows us to more easily see which nodes are connected without overlap. To do this we will change the layout.

When using RCy3 to drive Cytoscape, if we are not sure what the current values are for a layout or we are not sure what kinds of values are accepted for the different parameters of our layout, we can investigate using the RCy3 functions getLayoutPropertyNames() and then getLayoutPropertyValue().

```{r}
getLayoutNames(cw)
```

```{r}
getLayoutPropertyNames(cw, layout.name="force-directed")
```

```{r}
getLayoutPropertyValue(cw, "force-directed", "defaultSpringLength") 
```

```{r}
getLayoutPropertyValue(cw, "force-directed", "numIterations")  
```

Once we decide on the properties we want, we can go ahead and set fine-grained properties of a given layout like this:

```{r}
#setLayoutProperties(cw,
#                    layout.name = force-directed",
#                    list(defaultSpringLength = 20,
#                         "numIterations" = 200))
#layoutNetwork(cw,
#              layout.name = "force-directed")
#fitContent(cw)

```

For now let’s just use the default force-directed layout.
```{r}
layoutNetwork(cw, layout.name = "force-directed")
fitContent(cw)
```

## Look at network properties
One thing that might be interesting to visualize is nodes that are connected to many different nodes and nodes that are connected to few other nodes. The number of other nodes to which one node is connected is called degree. We can use a gradient of size to quickly visualize nodes that have high degree.
```{r}
## initiate a new node attribute
ug2 <- initNodeAttribute(graph = ug,
                          "degree",
                          "numeric",
                          0.0) 

## Use the igraph to calculate degree from the original graph
nodeData(ug2, nodes(ug2), "degree") <- igraph::degree(g)

cw2 <- CytoscapeWindow("Tara oceans with degree",
                      graph = ug2,
                      overwriteWindow = TRUE)
```

```{r}
displayGraph(cw2)
layoutNetwork(cw2)
```

## Size by degree
```{r}
degree_control_points <- c(min(igraph::degree(g)),
                           mean(igraph::degree(g)),
                           max(igraph::degree(g)))
node_sizes <- c(20,
                20,
                80,
                100,
                110) # number of control points in interpolation mode,
                     # the first and the last are for sizes "below" and "above" the attribute seen.

setNodeSizeRule(cw2,
                "degree",
                degree_control_points,
                node_sizes,
                mode = "interpolate")
```

```{r}
layoutNetwork(cw2,
              "force-directed")
```
